# IBRA - Interactive benchmarking of ranking and assignment methods

IBRA is a package to calculate and visualize performance metrics for 
ranking and binary assignment methods. A typical use case could be, 
for example, comparing methods calling differential expression in 
gene expression experiments, which could be seen as either a ranking 
problem (estimating the correct effect size and ordering the genes by 
significance) or a binary assignment problem (classifying the genes 
into differentially expressed and non-differentially expressed).

## Installation

The package can be installed using devtools:

```
devtools::install_github("markrobinsonuzh/IBRA")
```
