}
\arguments{
\item{fdrtpr}{A data frame containing observed FDR and TPR values at various
adjusted p-value thresholds.}

\item{fdrtprcurve}{A data frame containing observed FDR and TPR values for a
(potentially large) number of cutoffs applied to a 'score' (that can be
p-value, adjusted p-value or a more general score).}

\item{fdrnbr}{A data frame containing observed FDR and the number of features
considered to be significant at various adjusted p-value thresholds.}

\item{fdrnbrcurve}{A data frame containing observed FDR and number of
features considered to be significant for a (potentially large) number of
cutoffs applied to a 'score' (that can be p-value, adjusted p-value or a
more general score).}

\item{tpr}{A data frame containing observed TPR values at various adjusted
p-value thresholds.}

\item{fpr}{A data frame containing observed FPR values at various adjusted
p-value thresholds.}

\item{splv}{A character string giving the name of the stratification factor,
"none" if the results are not stratified.}

\item{roc}{A data frame containing observed FPR and TPR values  for a
(potentially large) number of cutoffs applied to a 'score' (that can be
p-value, adjusted p-value or a more general score), which can be used to
generate a ROC curve.}

\item{fpc}{A data frame containing observed numbers of false positive
findings among the N top-ranked features (ranked by p-values, adjusted
p-values or more general scores), for a (potentially large) number of Ns,
which can be used to generate a false positive curve.}

\item{deviation}{A data frame containing deviations between observed scores
and true scores.}

\item{overlap}{A data frame or list of data frames with binary values
indicating, for each of a number of methods and number of features, whether
the method consider the feature 'positive' (significant, 1) or 'negative'
(non-significant, 0). If it is a list of data frames, each list element
corresponds to one level of a stratifying factor.}

\item{maxsplit}{A numeric value indicating the largest number of levels to
retain if the results have been stratified by an annotation.}

\item{corr}{A data frame containing observed (Pearson and Spearman)
correlation values between observed and true scores.}

\item{scatter}{A data frame containing observed 'scores' (p-values, adjusted
p-values or more general scores) and true scores, which can be used to
generate scatter plots.}

\item{object_to_extend}{An \code{IBRAPerformance} object to extend with the
  provided information.}

\description{
The \code{IBRAPerformance} class holds various types of calculated
performance measures. Objects from this class are typically generated from
\code{IBRAData} object by means of the function
\code{\link{calculate_performance}}.
